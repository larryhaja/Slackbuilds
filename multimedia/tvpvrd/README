tvpvrd is a highly flexible and configurable server daemon that acts as an 
advanced digital TV recorder using one or several installed TV capture cards.

The server manages scheduled recordings and provides an efficient command 
language interface on a dedicated TCP/IP port. As an alternative interface the 
daemon also comes with a basic WEB-interface through the daemons built in 
micro-web-server. To keep the WEB-interface simple only the most common commands 
are available through this interface.

The goal with this project is to provide an advanced recording and transcoding 
(using ffmpeg) server without the need to configure complex databases or GUI. 
The daemon sits unobtrusively in the background.
