This module converts strings from and to 2-byte Unicode UCS2 format. All 
mappings happen via 2 byte UTF16 encodings, not via 1 byte UTF8 encoding. To 
transform these use Unicode::String.

For historical reasons this module coexists with Unicode::Map8. Please use 
Unicode::Map8 unless you need to care for two byte character sets, e.g. chinese 
GB2312. Anyway, if you stick to the basic functionality (see documentation) you 
can use both modules equivalently.
