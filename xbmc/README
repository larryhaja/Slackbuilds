XBMC is an award winning media center application for Linux, Mac OS X,
Windows and XBox. The ultimate hub for all your media, XBMC is easy to
use, looks slick, and has a large helpful community.  XBMC supports
viewing and playing a vast library of audio, video and image formats.
XBMC has a sophisticated library management system that allows you to
organize all your media to give you quick and immediate access.

XBMC requires libass, libmpeg2, libmodplug and yajl.

Optional: libcec, pulseaudio, libbluray, libnfs,
libdvdcss, vobcopy, lirc, cwiid, pybluez, libssh, id3lib,
libvdpau, rtmpdump, libmicrohttpd, libva, avahi, ffmpeg
(all available at slackbuilds.org).

Optional: afpfs-ng is also an optional build time requirement but
doesn't get picked up by xbmc due to lack of afpfs-ng header files.

Optional: libcrystalhd and shairpoint (not available at slackbuilds.org)

Below are some paramaters that can be passed to the slackbuild to turn
on some optional components.

EXT_FFMPEG=yes|no (Default is no), requires ffmpeg
USE_WII=yes|no (Default is no), requires cwiid and pybluez
WEBSERVER=yes|no (Default is no), requires libmicrohttpd

Note: The use of external ffmpeg is discouraged by the XBMC developers.
A patch is provided so XBMC can be built against newer ffmpeg. However,
this patch is NOT fully tested.
