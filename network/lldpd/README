LLDP allows you to know exactly on which port is a server (and reciprocally).
LLDP is an industry standard protocol designed to supplant proprietary
Link-Layer protocols such as EDP or CDP. The goal of LLDP is to provide an
inter-vendor compatible mechanism to deliver Link-Layer notifications to
adjacent network devices.

Optional dependencies: check, libbsd and jansonn or json-c

To compile lldpd with libseccomp support run the slackbuild with
SECCOMP=yes.

  # SECCOMP="yes" ./lldpd.SlackBuild
