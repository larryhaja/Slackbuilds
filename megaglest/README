MegaGlest is a free and open source 3D real-time strategy game where you control
the armies of one of seven different factions:  Tech, Magic, Egyptians, Indians,
Norsemen, Persian or Romans. The game is setup in one of 16 naturally looking
settings, which (like the unit models) are crafted with great appreciation for
detail.

This requires xerces-c, OpenAL, lua, ftgl and wxGTK/wxPython. Megaglest can
optionally use libircclient and miniupnpc. For manpages install help2man.
