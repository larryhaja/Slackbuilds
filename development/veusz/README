Veusz is a GUI scientific plotting and graphing package. It is designed to
produce publication-ready Postscript or PDF output. SVG, EMF and bitmap export
formats are also supported. The program runs under Unix/Linux, Windows or Mac OS
X, and binaries are provided. Data can be read from text, CSV or FITS files, and
data can be manipulated or examined from within the application.

In Veusz plots are created by building up plotting widgets with a consistent
object-based interface. The program also provides a command line and scripting
interface (based on Python) to its plotting facilities. It can also act as a
Python plotting module.

Requires numpy. Optional run time dependency is pyfits.
