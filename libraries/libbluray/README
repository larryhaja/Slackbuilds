libbluray is an open-source library designed for Blu-Ray Discs playback for
media players, like VLC or MPlayer.  libbluray integrates navigation, playlist
parsing, menus and BD-J.  libbluray is DRM-circumvention free, and thus, safe to
integrate in your software.

libbluray has no dependencies.  However, libbluray can make use of libaacs if
it is installed.  libbluray can also make use of java (aka bdjava) by 
additionally installing apache-ant and jdk and then running the script with
the extra parameter BDJAVA=yes sh libbluray.SlackBuild.

Most commercial Blu-Ray are protected by AACS or BD+ technologies and this
library is not enough to playback those discs.
