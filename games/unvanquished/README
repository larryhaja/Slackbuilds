Players fight online in team based combat in a war of aliens against humans.

While the humans are equipped with weapons that they use to exterminate the 
alien presence, the aliens have only their pincers and a few special attacks, 
such as poison gas, and ranged electrical and projectile attacks. Players do not 
spawn at random points in the map; instead, each map has default spawn points 
and both teams are capable of moving them wherever they please. Both teams have 
other buildings that round out their base, such as machinegun turrets for the 
humans and barricades for the aliens. Either team wins by destroying the 
opposing team's spawn points and killing any remaining members of that team 
before they are able to build any more spawn points or the game timer ends.

Optional dependency is mumble.
