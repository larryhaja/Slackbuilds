# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

unvanquished: unvanquishe (Alien vs. Human FPS)
unvanquished:
unvanquished: Players fight online in team based combat in a war of aliens against
unvanquished: humans. While the humans are equipped with weapons that they use to
unvanquished: exterminate the alien presence, the aliens have only their pincers
unvanquished: and a few special attacks, such as poison gas, and ranged electrical
unvanquished: and projectile attacks. Players do not spawn at random points in the
unvanquished: map; instead, each map has default spawn points and both teams are
unvanquished: capable of moving them wherever they please.
