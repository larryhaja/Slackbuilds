formerly ActionCube, is a free first-person-shooter
based on the game Cube. Set in a realistic looking
environment, as far as that´s possible with this
engine, while gameplay stays fast and arcade.

AssaultCube requires OpenAL.

Note: If upgrading from version 1.0 or earlier then the new
directory "~/.assaultcube_v1.1" will be created and previous
settings will not be applied to new version.
