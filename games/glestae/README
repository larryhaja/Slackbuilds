Glest Advanced Engine is a community driven project which extends and
improves on Glest. It aims to provide features and tools that help people
develop higher quality 3D real-time strategy games for all major platforms.

Glest Advanced Engine requires lua, OpenAL and physfs.

Optionally glestae can use wxGTK/wxPython and cppunit. wxGTK/wxPython will
build the optional gae_mapeditor and gae_g3dviewer.
