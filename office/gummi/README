Gummi is a lightweight Latex editor written in Python/GTK
released as open source under a dual MIT/Beerware license.
Latex is a powerful mark-up language that is widely used for
academic and professional documents.

Gummi requires gtksourceview. Gummi can also optionally use
texlive instead of tetex (which comes with Slackare).
