# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

pysrt: pysrt is mainly designed as a library, but if you are experiencing
pysrt: troubles with bad subtitles you can first try to use ruby-osdb which
pysrt: will try to find the best subtitle for your movie. If you are still
pysrt: unlucky pysrt also provide an srt command useful for either shift,
pysrt: split, or rescale a .srt file.
